## This project required to design and develop dashboard to answer different questions about superstore dataset.

## This is the Description and overview of the required project from udacity 

## Introduction
A startup called Sales_Rocket wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on their sales across the nation. Management has a few questions they’d like easy access to. Currently, they answer these questions through spreadsheets scattered about and a variety of different tools. Unfortunately, none of the spreadsheets and tools neatly combine all their answers into one.

They would like a dashboard designer to go through each question and try to come up with a way to display their data in a way that is neat and intuitive, even for the less data-savvy among them.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will apply what you have learned about designing with your audience in mind to build a useful dashboard prototype. To complete the project, you will need to create a prototype that allows users to intuitively answer the series of questions below. You can use any modern dashboarding tool you would like. You are free to use Tableau. For this project, you will be using the Superstore dataset.

## Questions:
Using the Superstore data file, you'll need to create dashboards to answer each of the following questions.

Your dashboard should display the data such that the audience can arrive at the answer.
What is the most profitable City in the State of Tennessee?
What’s the average annual profit for that city across all years in that city?
What’s the most profitable product category on average in Iowa across all years?”
What is the most popular product in that category across all states in 2016?
What was the most profitable month in 2018 overall?
How widely did monthly profits vary in 2018?
